</p>

A web app developed in two weeks at the end of Tech Elevator, as a final project. 

Our team was tasked with creating a 'Brewery Finder'-- but after a meeting with our product owner, it turned into somethings slightly different.

'Hoppy Trails' is a collection of curated brewery-crawl routes through Cleveland, OH, as well as a detailed list of every major brewery in town.

-Data gathered using OpenBreweryDB
https://www.openbrewerydb.org/

-Database built in MSSQL

-Server compiled in C#, tested with IIS Express through VS 2019

-Frontend assembled with Vue.js

-Graphics created in Paint.NET and Photoshop CC

(if you're local, maybe check out one of our routes some time-- they're pretty good!)
